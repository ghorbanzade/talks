# Software Engineering

- Programming
  - Theoretical problem solving
  - Like sport
- Software Engineering
  - Problem solving within business constraints
  - Like gardening

# Software Testing

- Good tests are:
  - Cheap to Write
  - Easy to Read
  - Fast to Run
  - Easy to Change

<div class="h-8" />

> Good tests have high return on investment.

<div class="h-8" />

> Good tests give you confidence when they pass and teach you something when they fail.

Improving Culture

# Active Debate

<div class="h-8" />

- Regular technical debt review
- Periodic code review policy
- Pair/Ensemble programming sessions
- Regular knowledge hand-off sessions
- Collecting and sharing software quality metrics

Improving Culture

# No Broken Windows

<div class="h-8" />

> In criminology, the broken windows theory states that visible signs of
> crime, anti-social behavior and civil disorder create an urban environment
> that encourages further crime and disorder, including serious crimes.
> The theory suggests that policing methods that target minor crimes such
> as vandalism, loitering, public drinking, jaywalking, and fare evasion
> help to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness.

The Problem

# How can we refactor half a million lines of code without causing any side effects?

---

<div class="h-full">
<div class="h-8" />

# Candidate Solution A

<div class="h-8" />

```cpp
auto new_output = new_system(testcase);
auto old_output = old_system(testcase);
compare(new_output, old_output);
```

<div class="h-8" />

## Disadvantages

<div class="h-8" />

- Test is difficult to setup
- Test system is inefficient to run
- Test system is not reusable

</div>

---

<div class="h-full">
<div class="h-8" />

# Candidate Solution B

<div class="h-8" />

```cpp
auto new_output = new_system(testcase);
auto new_file = write_to_file(testcase, new_output);
auto old_file = find_old_file(testcase);
compare(new_file, new_output);
```

<div class="h-8" />

## Disadvantages

<div class="h-8" />

- Dealing with files is no fun
- Test system is hard to maintain
- Test system is not reusable

## Approval Testing

<div class="h-full">
<div class="h-8" />

# Candidate Solution C

<div class="h-8" />

```cpp
auto new_output = new_system(testcase);
auto new_description = describe(new_output);
submit(testcase, new_description);
```

<div class="h-8" />

## Disadvantages

<div class="h-8" />

- Limited customization
- Overkill for small projects
- Requires remote computing resources

</div>

Example

# Code Under Test

```cpp
struct Student {
  std::string username;
  std::string fullname;
  Date birth_date;
  std::vector<Course> courses;
};

Student find_student(const std::string& username);
```

---

Example

# Regression Test

```cpp
#include "students.hpp"
#include "touca/touca.hpp"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  touca::workflow("students", [](const std::string& username) {
    const auto& student = find_student(username);
    touca::check("username", student.username);
    touca::check("fullname", student.fullname);
    touca::check("birth_date", student.birth_date);
    touca::check("courses", student.courses);
  });
  touca::run(argc, argv);
}
```

Example

# Serializing Custom Types

<div class="h-8" />

```cpp
template <>
struct touca::serializer<Date> {
  data_point serialize(const Date& value) {
    return object("Date")
        .add("year", value.year)
        .add("month", value.month)
        .add("day", value.day);
  }
};
```

Motivation

# Design Requirements

- Intuitive developer experience
- Intrinsic support for common types
  - Must support integral types, fractional types, Strings, Iterables,
    and other common standard types
- Extensible design to support user-defined types
  - Must allow users to introduce logic for handling custom types
